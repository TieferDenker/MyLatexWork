# Project Title

The Book of Amazing Proofs

## Description

This repository contains all the mathematics, physics and electronics engineering related proofs which are special to me.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The best part is there are no dependecies to read and contribute towards this amazing book.

### Installing

Another best part is that there are absolutely no hustle related to any kind of installations (isn't that great!)

### Executing program

Just run the latex code (which is basically a LaTex script (".tex" files)) in the any Tex file viewer or editor

## Help

Feel free to contact me if you find a proof that you feel is special and should be included in the book. Be it another rediscovered proof of the Pythagorean theorem or a proof of the Riemann hypothesis (would love to see that), I'll be happy to include it.  
Let's make it a global fun project to bring all those golden proofs out there in one place, most importantly, accessible to all!!!
